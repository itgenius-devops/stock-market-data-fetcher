# Stock Sync: Automating Market Data Delivery for the Analytics Team

Welcome to your **DevOps API challenge**. In this assignment, you are to simulate a real-world scenario where a **Data Analytics team** needs daily **stock market data** from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/)
.

Your task as a **DevOps Engineer** is to automate the download and storage of this data using shell scripting, Git, and cron jobs.

---

## âœ… Task Overview

Follow the steps below carefully:

### 1. Clone the Repository

- Use the `git clone` command to clone this repository to your local machine ( THIS JOB IS MEANT TO BE DONE IN YOUR LINUX SERVER ):
  ```
  https://github.com/itgenius-devops/stock-market-data-fetcher.git
  ```

---

### 2. Create and Switch to a New Branch

- Navigate into the cloned repository.
- Create a **new Git branch named after your GitHub username** (e.g., mine is `itgenius-devops`) and switch into it.
- *Hint: Use `git checkout -b <your-username>`*

---

### 3. Create Your Personal Folder

- Inside the repository (now on your own branch), create a folder using your **GitHub username**.
  - Example: `mkdir itgenius-devops`

---

### 4. Set Up Your Folder Structure

- Navigate into your newly created folder.
- Create the following items:
  - A shell script file named: `stock-market-data-fetcher.sh`
  - Three folders named:
    - `logs`
    - `json`
    - `csv`

You should now have four items inside your folder.

---

### 5. Write the Shell Script

Inside your `stock-market-data-fetcher.sh` script:

- Write a shell script that:
  - Downloads stock data in both **JSON** and **CSV** formats
  - For the following three dates:  
    - Wednesday, **9th April 2025**  
    - Thursday, **10th April 2025**  
    - Friday, **11th April 2025**
  - Saves:
    - JSON files in the `json/` folder
    - CSV files in the `csv/` folder
  - Files should be named like:
    - `ibm-intraday-2025-04-09.csv`
    - `ibm-intraday-2025-04-09.json`

> ðŸ’¡ **Hint**: You can use `wget` or `curl` to fetch the data from the Alpha Vantage API (URL).

---

### ðŸ“… API (URLs) to Use

- **CSV**:
  ```
  https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY&symbol=IBM&interval=5min&outputsize=full&datatype=csv&apikey=L2CS5Y3MI25MWQRY
  ```

- **JSON**:
  ```
  https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY&symbol=IBM&interval=5min&outputsize=full&datatype=json&apikey=L2CS5Y3MI25MWQRY
  ```

---

### 6. Set Up Cron Job

- Schedule a **cron job** that runs your script every day at **9:15 PM**.
- Logs generated by your script should be saved as:
  - `ibm-intraday-2025-04-09.log`
  - `ibm-intraday-2025-04-10.log`
  - `ibm-intraday-2025-04-11.log`
- All logs should be saved in the `logs/` folder.

---

### 7. Push Your Work and Submit a Pull Request

- Once your script and folder structure are complete:
  - Add, commit, and push your work **to your personal branch**
  - Open a **pull request (PR)** from your branch to the main or master branch
  - **Deadline:** Submit your pull request by **Saturday, 12th April 2025** before class

We will review and merge your work during our next session.

---

##  Expected Folder Structure

Hereâ€™s how your project should look from the root of the repository:

```
stock-market-data-fetcher/
â”œâ”€â”€ your-github-username/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ stock-market-data-fetcher.sh
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ csv/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ibm-intraday-2025-04-09.csv
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ibm-intraday-2025-04-10.csv
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ibm-intraday-2025-04-11.csv
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ json/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ibm-intraday-2025-04-09.json
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ibm-intraday-2025-04-10.json
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ibm-intraday-2025-04-11.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ logs/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ibm-intraday-2025-04-09.log
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ibm-intraday-2025-04-10.log
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ibm-intraday-2025-04-11.log
```
